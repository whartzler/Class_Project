1. Decide on a topic for the projectâ€”that is, think of a question that using data can answer.
2. Create a repository for the project, and then invite the other team members to join it.
3. Source a dataset or, if applicable, multiple datasets that will suit your needs.
4. Begin to clean, organize, and perform an exploratory data analysis on your datasets so that they're ready for analysis.
5. Include mock-ups of a machine learning model and a database
