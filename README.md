# Class_Project

## Segment 1
- [x] Create a repository for the project, and then invite the other team members to join it.
- [ ] Decide on a topic for the projectâ€”that is, think of a question that using data can answer
- [ ] Source a dataset or, if applicable, multiple datasets that will suit your needs.
- [ ] Begin to clean, organize, and perform an exploratory data analysis on your datasets so that they're ready for analysis.
- [ ] Include mock-ups of a machine learning model and a database

### Project Ideas
1. Electronic Vehicle Future involve some statistics/analysis vs Gas Vehicles
  - Regression model on CO2 emmisions based on increased EV usage
  - Regression on number of EV charging stations over time
    - Nicks Dataset - Stations folder:  EV Stations.CSV   
  - Predict future sales by EV Type
  - Charging times Year over Year

### EV Vehicle Impact

#### Washington Dataset
https://data.wa.gov/Transportation/Electric-Vehicle-Population-Data/f6w7-q2d2
 - Future Sales by vehicle type
 - Average Emissions Data by type
 - Electric Range vs gas range


## Things people wanna do
 - Ryan - ETL
 - Nick - ML & Viz (Tableau)
 - Christy - ML & Viz (Tableau)
 - Daniel - SQL
 - Warren - ETL and assist where needed

## Goals for 3/15 & week
 - Charging Times dataset - WH
 - Determine a possible 5th datapoint & corresponding dataset - WH
 - Gas datasets corresponding to EV datapoints - WH & RD


### Due Dates: 
 - Segment 1: March 22nd 
 - Segment 2: March 29
 - Segment 3: April 5th! & Final day of class
